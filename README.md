# Census_API_Choropleth_Map
Using Census data via API to create a Choropleth map.

This is an example of utilizing the U.S. Census Bureau's API key to access data from the American Community Survey (ACS) to
create a choropleth map. Geospatial data is enclosed in shapefiles that is accessed through U.S. Census Bureau's TIGERweb REST 
API. Geopandas is used to read and import data from the shapefiles.
